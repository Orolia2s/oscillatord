 *
 * Ublox F9 is handled by a thread that will configure it if requested and
 * parse incoming messages.
 * When enough data is collected to get a precise measure of the time, a signal is generated
 * to tell the rest program that PHC time can be set.
 * Thread uses ubloxcfg library to manage and decode data from the receiver.

 * Each input source has an associated type.  This is currently used in two
 * ways:
 *
 * (1) To determine if we require that gpsd be the only process opening a
 * device.  We make an exception for PTYs because the master side has to be
 * opened by test code.
 *
 * (2) To determine whether it's safe to send wakeup strings.  These are
 * required on some unusual RS-232 devices (such as the TNT compass and
 * Thales/Ashtech GPSes) but should not be shipped to unidentified USB
 * or Bluetooth devices as we don't even know in advance those are GPSes;
 * they might not cope well.
 *
 * Where it says "case detected but not used" it means that we can identify
 * a source type but no behavior is yet contingent on it.  A "discoverable"
 * device is one for which there is discoverable metadata such as a
 * vendor/product ID.
 *
 * We should never see a block device; that would indicate a serious error
 * in command-line usage or the hotplug system.
